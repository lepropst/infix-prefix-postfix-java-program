Class Descriptions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BTree:

	BinaryTree implementing class. implements methods and adds functionality
	to binary tree structure. Is parent class to NotationTranslator. Extends TreeNode which defines
	nodes used by BTree to construct BinaryTree.
	
TreeNode:
	
	Defines nodes of binary tree. Includes pointers to left, right, parent.
	includes setters and getters for nodes and element.
	
NotationTranslator:
	
	Extends BTree and acts as implementor of binary tree for given input
	its main purpose is to organize code to show that BTree is treated
	as an object and is instantiated upon parsing of input.
	
	Takes in a string in the constructor taken from the input reader used in 
	project 3.
	
Project3:

	Main method, takes in input from standard input and sends it line by line to 
	translator. outputs items generated by translator.
	
GraphicTree:
	Extends TreeNode is used to print Binary Tree in Console.
	



This shows the distinct functions of each class.
	
		project3 > parser/io operations
		NotationTranslator > parse/construct from input
		BTree > construct BinaryTree
		GraphicTree > prints tree graphically on console
		TreeNode > nodes for tree

BinaryTree:
	
	Interface that defines binary tree adt.
	Uses element E, implements methods for children, root, size, 
		and isInternal.
